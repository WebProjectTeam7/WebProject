_JavaScript Web Teamwork Assignment - **Gifs SPA Application**_

### 1. Project Descriptio

Design and implement a Gifs SPA application for searching and sharing funny gifs with your friends. The application should be able to display the top trending gifs, upload gifs and much more! For our purposes we are going to use the [Gyphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide)

</>

### 2. Project information

- Language and version: **JavaScript ES2020**
- Platform and version: **Node 14.0+**

</>

### 3. Step-by-step Guide

1. To use the **Giphy API**, first we need to register. Go [here](https://giphy.com/join?next=%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%2F%3Fresponse_type%3Dcode%26client_id%3DC7yftGDVCAhmaTnJCKv3eNaRsANYTDDf7PA9jZbw%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpartner-hub-api.giphy.com%252Fapi%252Fv1%252Flogin%253Fredirect_uri%253Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdevelopers.giphy.com%252F) and register to **Giphy**.
2. After you registered successfully, the next thing we want to do is to [create an app](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/). By creating an app, Giphy will provide us with an **api_key** that we are going to need in our future requests.

3. Select the **API** product and name your app
4. After you successfully created an app, you should have obtained an **api_key** for that app. Now we can get to work!
